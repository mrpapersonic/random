# code dump

### decodeurl.cpp
pretty self explanatory, compiled with libcurl and the likes

### deleteautosave.py
deletes openmpt autosave files, made cause they cluttered up my modules folder

### garf.cpp
this was a joke program i made when garf wanted to put ads on 1123.best

### getlist.py
gets episode names from MAL, thanks to the wonderful people who run the [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/) api<br>
meant to be used with rename.py

### intro.py
originally created to extract all of the yuru yuri intros

### mmltonsf.bat
this is a conversion of a script from bash to batch, it just makes compiling nsfs from mmls easier

### nhentai.py
i found a ton of nhentai codes on a facebook group and i wanted to sort them all. in it's current state you could literally do this with macros it's not that hard

### peardeck.cpp / peardeck.py
a bad peardeck sentence generator, will only accept inputs from 5-6 characters. i made a python version of this that i like much more than the c++ version

### pixivimageposter.py
posts images downloaded with pixivutil2 and interprets the id and image number from the filename

### python3path.bat
a batch script to put python3 in the path. made this cause my friend didn't know how paths worked

### remuxaudio.py
originally made cause i was pissy over some mkv files having thumbnails and different defaults from what i liked<br>
could've probably been made in batch but whatever, it was easier to do in python lmao

### rename.py
originally created for lucky star, this gets a ton of episode names (or whatever) from a list and renames files accordingly<br>
made this mainly cause i'm lazy and don't want to do manual renaming


### tenormoment.bat
another batch script that was made primarily to spam the ytpmv tag on tenor. it makes gifs of every 5 seconds of a given video file.<br>~~it is extremely unorganized, i might remake it later and remove the debug option that stands no purpose~~ done

### win95kg.cpp
a windows 95 keygen. iirc the oem key only works some of the time, i don't even remember why i made it. it also has shitty function names that i might clean up in the future
