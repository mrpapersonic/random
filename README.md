# code dump

### decodeurl.cpp
pretty self explanatory, compiled with libcurl and the likes

### garf.cpp
this was a joke program i made when garf wanted to put ads on 1123.best

### mmltonsf.bat
this is a conversion of a script from bash to batch, it just makes compiling nsfs from mmls easier

### nhentai.py
i found a ton of nhentai codes on a facebook group and i wanted to sort them all. in it's current state you could literally do this with macros it's not that hard

### peardeck.cpp / peardeck.py
a bad peardeck sentence generator, will only accept inputs from 5-6 characters. i made a python version of this that i like much more than the c++ version

### python3path.bat
a batch script to put python3 in the path. made this cause my friend didn't know how paths worked

### randomimageposter.py
posts random images of the file formats png, jpg, and gif

### tenormoment.bat
another batch script that was made primarily to spam the ytpmv tag on tenor. it makes gifs of every 5 seconds of a given video file.<br>~~it is extremely unorganized, i might remake it later and remove the debug option that stands no purpose~~ done

### win95kg.cpp
iirc the oem key only works some of the time, i don't even remember why i made it. it also has shitty function names that i might clean up in the future
