pretty self explanatory, compiled with libcurl and the likes

### [deleteautosave.py](deleteautosave.py)

### [garf.cpp](garf.cpp)

### [getlist.py](getlist.py)

meant to be used with rename.py

### [getskin.py](getskin.py)
gets a minecraft skin from a username<br>
meant to be used as reference for a possible future beta 1.7.3 (client-side) mod

### [intro.py](intro.py)
originally created to extract all of the yuru yuri intros

### [mmltonsf.bat](mmltonsf.bat)
this is a conversion of a script from bash to batch, it just makes compiling nsfs from mmls easier

### [nhentai.py](nhentai.py)
i found a ton of nhentai codes on a facebook group and i wanted to sort them all. in it's current state you could literally do this with macros it's not that hard

### [peardeck.cpp](peardeck.cpp) / [peardeck.py](peardeck.py)
a bad peardeck sentence generator, will only accept inputs from 5-6 characters. i made a python version of this that i like much more than the c++ version

### [pixivimageposter.py](pixivimageposter.py)
posts images downloaded with pixivutil2 and interprets the id and image number from the filename

### [python3path.bat](python3path.bat)
a batch script to put python3 in the path. made this cause my friend didn't know how paths worked

### [remuxaudio.py](remuxaudio.py)
originally made cause i was pissy over some mkv files having thumbnails and different defaults from what i liked<br>
could've probably been made in batch but whatever, it was easier to do in python lmao

### [rename.py](rename.py)
originally created for lucky star, this gets a ton of episode names (or whatever) from a list and renames files accordingly<br>
made this mainly cause i'm lazy and don't want to do manual renaming

### [sfv.py](sfv.py)
a very lazy implementation of Simple File Validator in python

### [tenormoment.bat](tenormoment.bat)
another batch script that was made primarily to spam the ytpmv tag on tenor. it makes gifs of every 5 seconds of a given video file.<br>~~it is extremely unorganized, i might remake it later and remove the debug option that stands no purpose~~ done

### [updatechromium.py](updatechromium.py)
updates ungoogled-chromium on arch linux. requires tqdm for sexy progress bars

### [win95kg.cpp](win95kg.cpp)
a windows 95 keygen. iirc the oem key only works some of the time, i don't even remember why i made it. it also has shitty function names that i might clean up in the future
